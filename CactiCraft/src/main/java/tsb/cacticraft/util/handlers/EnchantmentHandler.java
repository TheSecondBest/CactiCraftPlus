	Enchantment Changes: Runes

Enchantments are not applied directly, instead they are applied to runes (crafted using lapis or something) or found in chests. There are 4 tiers of equipment:
1- leather/flint
2- chain/stone
3- iron
4- diamond

Tier 1 has 3 rune slots, and every other tier has 6. A tool can be enhanced with a matierial to give an effect: 
-Gold to add 3 rune slots (gilded)
-Netherite to make unbreakable (brimsteel)
-Emerald to make runes removable (gemed)

Upgrades are made in the smithing table and require a block of gold or emerald, or a netherite ingot.

Runes add numeric values to numerous attributes, such as:
+.5m to reach
+.25 damage
+.5 specific damage
-.25 seconds cooldown (/quickdraw)
+.5 knockback
+100 dirability
+10% efficiency/lure
+1 seconds breath
+10% damage reduction
+20% specific damage reduction
+1 looting/fortune/luckofthesea
+1 damage reflection
+1 life-steal

Then some special runes, like:
-Ignore underwater mining debuff
-Ignore water speed debuff
-Double jump
-Auto-smelt
-Health boost
-Mending
-Frost walker
-Infinity
-Loyalty
-Multishot
-Piercing
