	//directly, so cannot be combined in the anvil and have that effect the runes. Runes should still be combineable for better
	//enchantments. Also, exponential xp cost must be removed, and retailered. perhaps a hard cap of 100 levels or so. This would mainly
	//(or only) be used for repairs, since the smithing table will be used for adding runes to weapons and will not cost.
