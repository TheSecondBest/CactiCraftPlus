	/*
	to replace the smithing table. Allows the enhancement of diamond tools with gold, netherite, or emerald.
	also allows the binding of runes (or unbinding, for emerald tools)
	
	Gold: adds 3 extra rune slots (for a total of 9) but reduces the durability? Also increases efficiency.
	Netherite: makes the item unbreakable, does not increase effeciency.
	Emerald: allows runes to be unbound and switched for other runes.
	
	The table will have a simple design, with a slot of the left for the item, a slot in the middle-left for enhancement
	(that would be crossed out of the item isn't diamond) and nine slots for runes. These slots would show the runes already bound
	to the item, but would be grayed out unless the item is emerald. If the item has no rune slots (leather/flint) than all slots are crossed out
	this would also happen if the item was given more than 9 runes with commands.
	
	[Gilded (gold), hellforged (netherite), and gemmed (emerald) would be tags on all diamond equipment that would change the texture and attributes,
	but this way all three tags could be added to any given tool with commands for creative purposes.] maybe don't do this.
